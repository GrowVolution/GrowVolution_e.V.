### § 1 Voluntariness
1. In accordance with §4 para. 1 of the statutes, paying membership contributions is voluntary.
2. Members may voluntarily contribute to support, maintain, and further develop the association’s infrastructure.
3. This contribution order provides members with guideline values that they may refer to when deciding on voluntary contributions.
4. The association is obligated to keep ongoing costs within a reasonable and potentially manageable range for its members.

### § 2 Ongoing Costs of the Association
1. The following table provides a transparent overview of all ongoing costs:

<table align="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Quantity</th>
      <th>Unit Price</th>
      <th>Total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Strato VC 8-32 Linux</td>
      <td align="center">1</td>
      <td align="end">€20.00</td>
      <td align="end">€20.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Domains
        <ul>
          <li>growvolution.org</li>
          <li>growv-mail.org</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td align="center">2</td>
      <td align="end">€1.50</td>
      <td align="end">€3.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

2. The costs of one-time purchases will be made accessible to all association members via the shared cloud environment.
3. Adjustments to this table are made by the general assembly twice per year, once in the 6th and once in the 12th calendar month.

### § 3 Guideline Values for Membership Contributions
1. The following table serves as a guideline value table in accordance with §1 para. 3 of the Contribution Order and is based on the services provided by the association:

<table align="center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Service Used</th>
      <th>Recommended Contribution</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cloud, mail server, community platform, and identity provider</td>
      <td align="end">€2.50</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Free beverages at regular meetups</td>
      <td align="end">€5.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

2. Ideally, the contributions paid correspond to the sum of all services used.
3. This table is adjusted alongside the listing of the association’s ongoing costs according to the time periods described in §2 para. 3 of the Contribution Order.
4. The general assembly commits to taking scaling effects into account when making adjustments.
