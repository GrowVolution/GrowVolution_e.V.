<h1 align="center">Statutes of the Association</h1>

<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Born from a deep dissatisfaction with the state of our world and arising from a time of alienation – an alienation from ourselves, from one another, and from nature,
  this association shall be a light in the darkness for humanity for all time.<br><br>
  The members of this association have come together to take joint responsibility for their lives and their community, creating a framework in which they have the opportunity to grow beyond themselves freely
  and independently. They recognize their own role in the events of this world and thereby voluntarily commit themselves to serving a greater whole.<br><br>
  We now direct the raised finger back at ourselves and release our old judgment. For we are human, and as humans, we are fallible. With this admission, we allow ourselves to design structures
  that cushion our own fallibility.
