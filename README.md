# GrowVolution e.V.
Hey! 👋🏼<br><br>
This is our official association repository. We want to try something new and make governance architecture open source. 📝<br><br>
You can find our statutes and orders here. So you can participate on improvements of our internal structure, use ist as an inspiration for your own institutions or just review our current infrastructure. 💯

## 🔱 Branching rules and meaning
To keep the developement of our internal architecture clean, we want to provide a short introduction into our branching system:
1. main - Contains the adopted versions of our governance documents. Can only be changed by pull requests. A pull request will initiate internal the adoption process.
2. unadopted - Is the actively maintained branch wich contains the current state of our documents before adoption.
3. orders/* - Contains newly created orders and their developments before they are merged into the unadopted branch.

## ℹ️ Further information
- This repository is licensed by the [GPL Version 3](LICENSE).
- To reduce the barriers of our international audience, we are preffering english repositories. But scince our associationn is (currently not finally) registered in germany, the original documents were created in german. English versions are translated by AI.
